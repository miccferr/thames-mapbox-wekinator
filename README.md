# thames-mapbox-wekinator
Initial test for an interactive installation about the Thames plastic pollution.

Built with Wekinator + Mapbox GL Js + Node 

Communications done via OSC + Websockets


###note:

remember that `wn.on()` is no longer mantained. Thus until you can find an alternative you might want to replace the original `wekinator-node.js` lib in `node_modules` with an older version that supports it.
